# Generating Certificate

Download and use mkcert from mkcert.dev to generate the local certificate for this project. You will need to install the root certificate it generates and make sure not to give that out to anybody. Make sure to generate a PKCS 12 certificate and place it in the src/main/resources/keystore folder.
