Testing Homepage Map:
    A. Identification and Classification
        Test Case: 601
        System: map on the homepage (/)
        Description: interacting with the map
        Severity: 1

        Sprint: 2
        User Story: 1

    When loading the web application, it defaults to our homepage. This homepage contains a map of Purdue's campus in 
    West Lafayette, and a sidebar on the left of the page. A "+" button in the lower right corner of the map allows it to be 
    zoomed in. A "-" button in the lower right corner of the map allows it to be zoomed out. The scroll wheel on the mouse can
    also be used to zoom in and out on the map (only if the mouse cursor is over the map on the page, scrolling on the sidebar
    works as expected). Clicking on the map and dragging allows the user to pan the map in all directions. The arrow keys on 
    the keyboard can also be used for panning (as long as the map has been most recently clicked on).

Testing Map Buildings:
    A. Identification and Classification
        Test Case: 701
        System: /       (home page)
        Description: Building Outlines on Map
        Severity: 1
        
        Sprint: 2
        User Story: 4
        Task: 4
    
    B. Instructions
        1. Open the page
        2. Scroll around on the map

    C. Expected result
        1. Confirm the map appears
        2. Ensure at Purdue West Lafayette's campus, academic buildings have an accurate
            outline representing their building architecture.

Testing Map Building Labels:
    A. Identification and Classification
        Test Case: 801
        System: /       (home page)
        Description: Building Labels on Map
        Severity: 1
        
        Sprint: 2
        User Story: 6
        Task: 4
    
    B. Instructions
        1. Open the page and scroll around on the map

    C. Expected result
        1. Ensure at Purdue West Lafayette's campus, academic buildings have a label on outlined buildings
            that accurately represents that building's shortcode, ex. Wilmeth Active Learning Center -> WALC.

Testing Buildings From Sidebar to Map:
    A. Identification and Classification
        Test Case: 901
        System: /       (home page)
        Description: Sidebar & Map component interactions
        Severity: 1

    On the main page, notice the sidebar on the left, and the map on the right. On default, the filter is set to Building.
    See "Testing Sidebar Filtering" above for more information about that. The search bar will allow us to search for all
    buildings by having an empty string and hitting the search button. Alternatively, you can search for a specific building
    by typing in its full name, part of its name, or its shortcode. Do this by typing something like "Max W & Maileen Brown Hall", 
    which is the most recent name for the Electrical Engineering building (BHEE). You can also search just "Pharmacy" to see the 
    Robert Heine Pharamcy Building (RHPH) in the sidebar. You can also search "WALC" to see the Wilmeth Active Learning Center (WALC)
    in the sidebar. For testing the buildings, click on a building in the sidebar. This will cause the map to pan to the location of 
    that building, and change the highlight color for that building. Confirm that the shape of the building's highlight is where the 
    building actually is and that the map panned to the correct highlighted building. Repeat these steps with other buildings on
    Purdue's campus and confirm the map pans correctly and their highlights display correctly.

Testing Homepage Floating Buttons:
    A. Identification and Classification
        Test Case: 1001
        System: /       (home page)
        Description: buttons on the homepage that appear depending on whether or not a user is currently signed in
        Severity: 1

    There are a collection of floating buttons that appear in the upper right corner of the home page of our application. 
    These buttons are for logging in, signing out, accessing the account settings page, accessing the favorites page, and 
    accessing the user schedule page. The Log In button only appears if you are not currently logged into an account, and 
    the other buttons only appear if you are currently loggen into an account. When loading the application initially, 
    you should not be logged into an account. Therefore, the only button that appears in the top right is the "LOG IN" 
    button. Clicking this button leads to the login page (See above "Testing Account Login" section for more info). 
    Once logged in, the "LOG IN" button disappears, and the following buttons appear in the top right of the homepage 
    (from right to left): "SIGN OUT", "ACCOUNT SETTINGS", "FAVORITES", and "MY SCHEDULE". Clicking "MY SCHEDULE" leads to
    the user schedule page. Clicking "FAVORITES" leads to the user favorites page. Clicking "ACCOUNT SETTINGS" leads to the 
    modify account page. Clicking "SIGN OUT" logs the user out of the application and reloads the homepage. Once reloaded,
    these four buttons will disappear and the "LOG IN" button will appear. Also, the star icon buttons on each sidebar 
    element will only appear when the user is logged in, and disappear when the user logs out. 

Testing Login Redirection:
    A. Identification and Classification
        Test Case: 1101
        Systems: /deleteacct, /modifyAccount, /schedule, /favorites
        Description: buttons on the homepage that appear depending on whether or not a user is currently signed in
        Severity: 1
    Navigate to the '/deleteacct', '/modifyAccount', '/schedule', and '/favorites' pages while logged in to ensure that they
    load as expected. Using the button on the homepage, sign out of your current account. Navigate to each of the four pages
    listed above and see that they redirect to the login page. 
    
    This can also be tested by navigating to these pages when first loading the application before ever logging in, and they
    will each still redirect to the login page.



Testing Favoriting Star:
    A. Identification and Classification
        Test Case: 1201
        Systems: / (home page) sidebar favoriting "star"
        Description: A clickable star should be displayed in each item showing if it is currently favorited
        Severity: 2

    B. Instructions
        1. With a new account, click on the star for the first and second item in the list of buildings
        2. Refresh the page
        3. Click on the star again for the first item in the list of buildings
        4. Refresh the page
        5. Click the "Sign Out" button
        6. Log back in using the same account

    C. Expected result
        1. The stars for the first and second items in the list of buildings should be yellow, the rest of the start should be white
        2. After page refresh, the first two stars should still be yellow and the rest should still be white.
        3. The first item's star should no longer be yellow (after clicking it), the second item's star should still be yellow,
           and the rest of the items' stars should be white.
        4. After page refresh, the only star that should be yellow is the second item'same
        5. After signing out and logging back in, the second item's star in the list of buildings should still be yellow while the rest
           of the items' stars should still be white.



Testing Favoriting Page Functionality:
    A. Identification and Classification
        Test Case: 1202
        Systems: / (home page) sidebar favoriting "star", /favorites
        Description: The favorites page should show a list of favorites that match the yellow stars in the sidebar
        Severity: 2

    B. Instructions
        1. With a new account, click on the star for the first item in the list of buildings
        2. Change the filter to Course and enter "CS" in the search bar
        3. Click the star for the first item in the list of CS courses
        4. Click the first CS course item, displaying a list of sections in the course
        5. Click the star for the first item in the list of sections
        6. Go to the favorites page and view the favorites in the lists
        7. Click on the favorited item in the buildings list to remove it from favorites
        8. Go back to the home Page

    C. Expected result
        1. Only the first star should be yellow in the buildings list (after clicking on it)
        2. After filtering for CS courses, none of the stars should be yellow
        3. Only the first star should be yellow in the list of CS courses (after clicking on it)
        4. Clicking the first CS course should display a list of sections with none of the stars being yellow
        5. Only the first star should be yellow in the list of sections (after clicking on it)
        6. The favorites page should have the same items that were favorited each in their repective
           lists (each list should only have one item)
        7. After clicking the only item in the buildings list, the buildings list should be empty
        8. Going back to the home page, it should display a list of buildings, and the first item's star should no longer be yellow
