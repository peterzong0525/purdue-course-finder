This document is for manually testing User Interfaces (UI) in the Purdue Course Finder Project

Testing Account Signup:
    Upon loading the /signup page, there will be a Purdue looking page containing a gold box
    with fields for the email address, password, and confirming the password. There is also a
    button for signing up and a link for users if they already have an account. Confirm this
    link redirects users to the login page and return. 
    The email address field must fit an appropriate email address format, of x@x.x. You can 
    confirm this by inputting different incorrect emails. (The passwords do not have such 
    formats.) You can also try to input 2 different passwords and notice the result will catch 
    the error. After an account is created, the same email cannot be used. After filling out 
    each field, confirm your account by hitting 'Sign Up'. Come back to the sign up page and 
    re-enter the same email. Confirm the error message 
    'A user with that email address already exists.' is displayed.

Testing Account Deletion:
    On the delete account page, currently under path /deleteacct, there should be a header at
    the top of the page displaying 'Purdue Course Finder' and a back button to go back to the
    home page (/). Confirm that button takes the user back to the home page and then return to
    the /deleteacct page. After account creation is all set up, a user's first name, last name,
    and email will be displayed on the page. 
    There should also be a button under the user info displaying 'Delete Account'. Upon pressing 
    it, a popup window will appear and ask the user if they are sure they want to delete their
    account. Hit F12 or inspect element to open the console. When pressing 'Confirm', the
    window, should print to the console the server's response of "No user exists for that 
    email." since user information isn't stored on the browser side yet. To confirm with a real
    account, create an account using email 'testemail' and password 'testpassword' refollow the
    steps above. Additionally, if the popup is open, the 'X' button should close it.
