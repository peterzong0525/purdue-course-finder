    When loading the web application, it defaults to our homepage. This homepage contains a map of Purdue's campus in 
    West Lafayette, and a sidebar on the left of the page. A "+" button in the lower right corner of the map allows it to be 
    zoomed in. A "-" button in the lower right corner of the map allows it to be zoomed out. The scroll wheel on the mouse can
    also be used to zoom in and out on the map (only if the mouse cursor is over the map on the page, scrolling on the sidebar
    works as expected). Clicking on the map and dragging allows the user to pan the map in all directions. The arrow keys on 
    the keyboard can also be used for panning (as long as the map has been most recently clicked on).

        2. After clicking on a building in the sidebar, the map should zoom in to the building and the outline of 
           only that building should be highlighted (the color of the building highlight will change color)
           For example: If WALC is clicked in the sidebar, the map zooms to the location of the building and WALC's outline is highlighted
        3. When the search bar is queried (with or without any search input), the previously highlighted building should no longer be highlighted
           (the color will change back to the default yellow)
