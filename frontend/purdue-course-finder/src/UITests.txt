        Description: Creating an Account
        Severity: 1

        Sprint: 1 
        User Story: 3

    B. Instructions
        Upon loading the /signup page, there will be fields for an email address, password, 
        and confirming the password along with a button for signing up and a link for users
        if they already have an account. Enter the account info to create an account.
        The email address field must fit an appropriate email address format, of x@x.x.
        The password and password confirm fields must be equal to each other.
        The password must meet minimum password complexity requirements:
            - Minimum of 8 characters
            - Minimum of 1 uppercase and 1 lowercase character
            - Minimum of 1 number

    C. Expected result
        1. If the email is already in use, the password doesn't match the password confirm,
           or the password doesn't meet necessary complexity requirements, an error message is displayed.
        2. If successful, a green popup with a link to the login page should show up.

            sort by 'Ascending' and 'Descending' options appear. (Note: Classrooms are going to be

        Description: interacting with the map
        Severity: 1

        Sprint: 2
        User Story: 1

    When loading the web application, it defaults to our homepage. This homepage contains a map of Purdue's campus in 
    West Lafayette, and a sidebar on the left of the page. A "+" button in the lower right corner of the map allows it to be 
    zoomed in. A "-" button in the lower right corner of the map allows it to be zoomed out. The scroll wheel on the mouse can
    also be used to zoom in and out on the map (only if the mouse cursor is over the map on the page, scrolling on the sidebar
    works as expected). Clicking on the map and dragging allows the user to pan the map in all directions. The arrow keys on 
    the keyboard can also be used for panning (as long as the map has been most recently clicked on).

Testing Map Buildings:
    A. Identification and Classification
        Test Case: 701
        System: /       (home page)

        User Story: 4
        Task: 4
    
    B. Instructions
        1. Open the page
        2. Scroll around on the map

    C. Expected result
        1. Confirm the map appears
        2. Ensure at Purdue West Lafayette's campus, academic buildings have an accurate
            outline representing their building architecture.

Testing Map Building Labels:
    A. Identification and Classification
        Test Case: 801
        System: /       (home page)
        Description: Building Labels on Map
        Severity: 3
        
        Sprint: 2
        User Story: 6
        Task: 4
    
    B. Instructions
        1. Open the page and scroll around on the map

    C. Expected result
        1. Ensure at Purdue West Lafayette's campus, academic buildings have a label on outlined buildings
            that accurately represents that building's shortcode, ex. Wilmeth Active Learning Center -> WALC.

Testing Buildings From Sidebar to Map:
    A. Identification and Classification
        Test Case: 901
        System: /       (home page)
        Description: Sidebar & Map component interactions
        Severity: 2

    On the main page, notice the sidebar on the left, and the map on the right. On default, the filter is set to Building.
    See "Testing Sidebar Filtering" above for more information about that. The search bar will allow us to search for all
    buildings by having an empty string and hitting the search button. Alternatively, you can search for a specific building
    by typing in its full name, part of its name, or its shortcode. Do this by typing something like "Max W & Maileen Brown Hall", 
    which is the most recent name for the Electrical Engineering building (BHEE). You can also search just "Pharmacy" to see the 
    Robert Heine Pharamcy Building (RHPH) in the sidebar. You can also search "WALC" to see the Wilmeth Active Learning Center (WALC)
    in the sidebar. For testing the buildings, click on a building in the sidebar. This will cause the map to pan to the location of 
    that building, and change the highlight color for that building. Confirm that the shape of the building's highlight is where the 
    building actually is and that the map panned to the correct highlighted building. Repeat these steps with other buildings on
    Purdue's campus and confirm the map pans correctly and their highlights display correctly.
