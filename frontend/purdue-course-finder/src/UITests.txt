Testing Account Deletion:
    On the delete account page, currently under path /deleteacct, there should be a header at
    the top of the page displaying 'Purdue Course Finder' and a back button to go back to the
    home page (/). Confirm that button takes the user back to the home page and then return to
    the /deleteacct page. After account creation is all set up, a user's first name, last name,
    and email will be displayed on the page. 
    There should also be a button under the user info displaying 'Delete Account'. Upon pressing 
    it, a popup window will appear and ask the user if they are sure they want to delete their
    account. Hit F12 or inspect element to open the console. When pressing 'Confirm', the
    window, should print to the console the server's response of "No user exists for that 
    email." since user information isn't stored on the browser side yet. To confirm with a real
    account, create an account using email 'testemail' and password 'testpassword' refollow the
    steps above. Additionally, if the popup is open, the 'X' button should close it.
