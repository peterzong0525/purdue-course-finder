This document is for manually testing User Interfaces (UI) in the Purdue Course Finder Project

Testing Account Signup:
    Upon loading the /signup page, there will be a Purdue looking page containing a gold box
    with fields for the email address, password, and confirming the password. There is also a
    button for signing up and a link for users if they already have an account. Confirm this
    link redirects users to the login page and return. 
    The email address field must fit an appropriate email address format, of x@x.x. You can 
    confirm this by inputting different incorrect emails. (The passwords do not have such 
    formats.) You can also try to input 2 different passwords and notice the result will catch 
    the error. After an account is created, the same email cannot be used. After filling out 
    each field, confirm your account by hitting 'Sign Up'. Come back to the sign up page and 
    re-enter the same email. Confirm the error message 
    'A user with that email address already exists.' is displayed.


Testing Account Login: 
    Load the /login page. The page contains a gold box labeled "Purdue Course Finder Log In". This box contains fields 
    for an email address and a password, followed by a black "Log In" button. Below that button are links labeled
    "Forgot Password?" and "Create an Account". Clicking the "Create an Account" link leads to the /signup page. 
    Return to the /login page to continue testing here. Since the password recovery feature has not yet been implemented, 
    the "Forgot Password?" link redirects to the homepage. Attempt to login without entering anything, see an error that states
    that an email address is required. Attempt to login with an email entered but no password, see an error that states that 
    a password is required. Enter an invalid email & password combination and click "Log In", see an error that states 
    "The email address or password entered is incorrect". Enter a valid email with an invalid password and click "Log In", 
    see an error that states "The email address or password entered is incorrect". Enter a valid password with an invalid email 
    and click "Log In", see an error that states "The email address or password entered is incorrect". Enter the email & password 
    credentials for a previously created account and click "Log In". Upon successful login, the user is redirected to the home page 
    (When the home page is implemented it will show that the user is logged in).


Testing Account Deletion:
    On the delete account page, currently under path /deleteacct, there should be a header at
    the top of the page displaying 'Purdue Course Finder' and a back button to go back to the
    home page (/). Confirm that button takes the user back to the home page and then return to
    the /deleteacct page. After account creation is all set up, a user's first name, last name,
    and email will be displayed on the page. 
    There should also be a button under the user info displaying 'Delete Account'. Upon pressing 
    it, a popup window will appear and ask the user if they are sure they want to delete their
    account. Hit F12 or inspect element to open the console. When pressing 'Confirm', the
    window, should print to the console the server's response of "No user exists for that 
    email." since user information isn't stored on the browser side yet. To confirm with a real
    account, create an account using email 'testemail' and password 'testpassword' refollow the
    steps above. Additionally, if the popup is open, the 'X' button should close it.

Testing Sidebar Component Clicking:
    In the sidebar, components consisting of either buildings, classrooms, courses, or sections.
    When clicking on a course, the sidebar should refresh to show section components that are
    relevant to the selected course. Similarly, when a building is clicked, classrooms that are
    inside the selected building should repopulate the sidebar.

Testing Sidebar Filtering:
    On the main page, there is a sidebar to the left of the map. The filter for the sidebar
    defaults to Courses. In order to change the filtering option, press the 'Filter' button and
    a popup window should appear with the options 'Building', 'Classroom', 'Course', and
    'Section'. You can leave the boxes unchecked if you want to stay on Courses or change the
    filter to another type. To test filtering, type in something such as 'MA' or 'ENGL' and press
    either enter on your keyboard or press the magnifying glass. After a couple of seconds,
    observe the classes appear in the sidebar. Visually confirm your search string created the
    correct courses or other filtering option you selected.

Testing Homepage Map:
    When loading the web application, it defaults to our homepage. This homepage contains a map of Purdue's campus in 
    West Lafayette, and a sidebar on the left of the page. A "+" button in the lower right corner of the map allows it to be 
    zoomed in. A "-" button in the lower right corner of the map allows it to be zoomed out. The scroll wheel on the mouse can
    also be used to zoom in and out on the map (only if the mouse cursor is over the map on the page, scrolling on the sidebar
    works as expected). Clicking on the map and dragging allows the user to pan the map in all directions. The arrow keys on 
    the keyboard can also be used for panning (as long as the map has been most recently clicked on).

Testing Buildings From Sidebar to Map:
    On the main page, notice the sidebar on the left, and the map on the right. On default, the filter is set to Building.
    See "Testing Sidebar Filtering" above for more information about that. The search bar will allow us to search for all
    buildings by having an empty string and hitting the search button. Alternatively, you can search for a specific building
    by typing in its full name, part of its name, or its shortcode. Do this by typing something like "Max W & Maileen Brown Hall", 
    which is the most recent name for the Electrical Engineering building (BHEE). You can also search just "Pharmacy" to see the 
    Robert Heine Pharamcy Building (RHPH) in the sidebar. You can also search "WALC" to see the Wilmeth Active Learning Center (WALC)
    in the sidebar. For testing the buildings, click on a building in the sidebar. This will cause the map to pan to the location of 
    that building, and change the highlight color for that building. Confirm that the shape of the building's highlight is where the 
    building actually is and that the map panned to the correct highlighted building. Repeat these steps with other buildings on
    Purdue's campus and confirm the map pans correctly and their highlights display correctly.

Testing Homepage Floating Buttons:
    There are a collection of floating buttons that appear in the upper right corner of the home page of our application. 
    These buttons are for logging in, signing out, accessing the account settings page, accessing the favorites page, and 
    accessing the user schedule page. The Log In button only appears if you are not currently logged into an account, and 
    the other buttons only appear if you are currently loggen into an account. When loading the application initially, 
    you should not be logged into an account. Therefore, the only button that appears in the top right is the "LOG IN" 
    button. Clicking this button leads to the login page (See above "Testing Account Login" section for more info). 
    Once logged in, the "LOG IN" button disappears, and the following buttons appear in the top right of the homepage 
    (from right to left): "SIGN OUT", "ACCOUNT SETTINGS", "FAVORITES", and "MY SCHEDULE". Clicking "MY SCHEDULE" leads to
    the user schedule page. Clicking "FAVORITES" leads to the user favorites page. Clicking "ACCOUNT SETTINGS" leads to the 
    modify account page. Clicking "SIGN OUT" logs the user out of the application and reloads the homepage. Once reloaded,
    these four buttons will disappear and the "LOG IN" button will appear. Also, the star icon buttons on each sidebar 
    element will only appear when the user is logged in, and disappear when the user logs out. 

Testing Login Redirection:
    Navigate to the '/deleteacct', '/modifyAccount', '/schedule', and '/favorites' pages while logged in to ensure that they
    load as expected. Using the button on the homepage, sign out of your current account. Navigate to each of the four pages
    listed above and see that they redirect to the login page. 
    
    This can also be tested by navigating to these pages when first loading the application before ever logging in, and they
    will each still redirect to the login page.
