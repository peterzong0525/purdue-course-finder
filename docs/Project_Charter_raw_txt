Project Title: 

Purdue Course Finder 

 

Problem Statement: 

Many students see their schedule at the beginning of the year and must go searching for their classes. Making this process harder, Google Maps often doesn’t recognize building acronyms, making it even more difficult to find classroom locations. Our product will eliminate that issue by providing a map of Purdue which outlines buildings, classrooms, the courses in those classrooms, the time slots of those courses, and more. This map will also be searchable using the names or acronyms of buildings, or by using course numbers or titles. This will help students to find exactly where their classes are, find more information about the classrooms and buildings, and see the locations of other sections for their courses. 

 

Project Objectives: 

Build an interactive website that helps students locate classrooms and get detailed information about the classes in those rooms 

Create a user account system to save favorites of specific classrooms, buildings, courses, and sections 

Create a system to filter what shows on the map and the accompanying sidebar list 

Create a system to view schedules of when and where specific classes meet 

Create a system to view schedules of what classes meet in a specific building or room 

Generate statistics on how often classrooms or buildings are used
